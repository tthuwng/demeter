**Problems**:

- Farmers have revenue losses and connections with consumers due to Covid-19.

- Consumers have trouble accessing organic food direct from farmers leading to food waste.

- Farmers have problems in dealing with diseases and access to efficient practices.

**Our Solution**:
<br/>

- An online market where consumers could search for local crops in their areas and be connected to farmers who are selling the matching products.

- A convenient place for farmers to manage their crops out of diseases and access to sustainable solutions and experts
