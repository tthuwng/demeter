**Problems**:

- Farmers have revenue losses and connections with consumers due to Covid-19.

- Consumers have trouble accessing organic food direct from farmers leading to food waste.

- Farmers have problems in dealing with diseases and access to efficient practices.

**Our Solution**:
<br/>

- An online market where consumers could search for local crops in their areas and be connected to farmers who are selling the matching products.

- A convenient place for farmers to manage their crops out of diseases and access to sustainable solutions and experts

### Built With

- **Frontend**: Swifts for iOS app development

- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore and Firebase Realtime database for data storage, Firebase Storage for images (crops, detected results) storage
- **Technologies**: Google Pay for app payment
- **Programming Languages**: Swift, Python
- **Tools**: Xcode, Google Colab Pro for Training Tensorflow Model, Google Cloud Run to host Tensorflow Model in Docker Container
